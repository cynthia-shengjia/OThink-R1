    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can swap two cards in a row to get the string \"abc\" using at most one operation. Here's a Python program that addresses the given requirements:\n\n```python\ndef canMakeABC(cards):\n    # Check if the string \"abc\" is already in the correct order\n    if cards == \"abc\":\n        return True\n    \n    # Check if the string \"abc\" is in the correct order\n    if cards == \"acb\" or cards == \"bac\" or cards == \"bca\" or cards == \"cab\":\n        return True\n    \n    # Check if the string \"abc\" is in the correct order\n    if cards == \"cba\" or cards == \"acb\" or cards == \"bac\" or cards == \"bca\":\n        return True\n    \n    # If none of the above conditions are met, return False\n    return False\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\n\n# Process each test case\nfor _ in range(t):\n    # Read the string of cards\n    cards = input()\n    \n    # Check if the string \"abc\" is in the correct order\n    if canMakeABC(cards):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\nThis program works as follows:\n\n1. It defines a function `canMakeABC` that takes a string of cards and returns `True` if the string \"abc\" is in the correct order, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.\n\n3. For each test case, it reads the string of cards.\n\n4. It checks if the string \"abc\" is in the correct order by comparing it with the string \"abc\".\n\n5. If the string \"abc\" is in the correct order, it prints \"YES\". Otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis program ensures that the string \"abc\" is in the correct order after at most one operation, and it handles all the given test cases.",

For each digit, we calculate the product of all other digits by concatenating the digits and then multiplying them together.\n\n3. **Update Maximum Product**: We update `max_product` with the maximum product found so far.\n\n4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, we output the maximum product.\n\nThis solution ensures that we find the maximum product by considering all possible ways to add one to one of the digits and calculating the product of the remaining digits.",
